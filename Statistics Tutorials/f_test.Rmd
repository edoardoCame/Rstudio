### Steps to Perform an F-Test with Sample Variances

1.  **Formulate Hypotheses**:
    -   **Null Hypothesis (**$H_0$): The variances of returns in 2007 and 2008 are equal. $$
        H_0: \sigma^2_{2007} = \sigma^2_{2008}
        $$
    -   **Alternative Hypothesis (**$H_a$): The variance of returns in 2008 is greater than that in 2007. $$
        H_a: \sigma^2_{2008} > \sigma^2_{2007}
        $$
2.  **Compute the F-Statistic**:
    -   The F-statistic is the ratio of the two sample variances. $$
        F = \frac{s^2_{2008}}{s^2_{2007}}
        $$
3.  **Determine the Degrees of Freedom**:
    -   $df_{2007} = n_{2007} - 1$, where $n_{2007}$ is the sample size for 2007.
    -   $df_{2008} = n_{2008} - 1$, where $n_{2008}$ is the sample size for 2008.
4.  **Find the Critical Value**:
    -   Use the F-distribution table to find the critical value $F_{critical}$ at a chosen significance level ($\alpha$), typically 0.05, with degrees of freedom $df_{2008}$ and $df_{2007}$.
5.  **Compare the F-Statistic to the Critical Value**:
    -   If $F$ is greater than $F_{critical}$, reject the null hypothesis.

### Example in R

Here is an example of how to perform this analysis in R when you have the sample variances and sample sizes:

```{r}
# Given sample variances and sample sizes
var_2007 <- 4.8  # Example variance for 2007
var_2008 <- 12.49   # Example variance for 2008
n_2007 <- 52         # Sample size for 2007
n_2008 <- 52         # Sample size for 2008

# Calculate the F-statistic
F_statistic <- var_2008 / var_2007

# Degrees of freedom
df1 <- n_2008 - 1
df2 <- n_2007 - 1

# Significance level
alpha <- 0.05

# Critical value from the F-distribution
F_critical <- qf(1 - alpha, df1, df2)

# Print the results
cat("F-statistic:", F_statistic, "\n")
cat("F-critical:", F_critical, "\n")

# Compare the F-statistic to the critical value
if (F_statistic > F_critical) {
  cat("Reject the null hypothesis: Variance in 2008 is significantly greater than in 2007.\n")
} else {
  cat("Fail to reject the null hypothesis: No significant difference in variances.\n")
}
```

### Explanation

-   **Input Data**:
    -   `var_2007` and `var_2008` are the sample variances for 2007 and 2008, respectively.
    -   `n_2007` and `n_2008` are the sample sizes for 2007 and 2008, respectively.
-   **Calculate F-Statistic**:
    -   The F-statistic is calculated as the ratio of the sample variances.
-   **Degrees of Freedom**:
    -   Degrees of freedom are calculated based on the sample sizes.
-   **Critical Value**:
    -   The critical value is obtained from the F-distribution for the specified significance level.
-   **Comparison**:
    -   The F-statistic is compared to the critical value to determine if the null hypothesis should be rejected.

By following these steps, you can perform the F-test even if you only have the sample variances and sample sizes.
